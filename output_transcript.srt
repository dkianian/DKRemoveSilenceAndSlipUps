 Welcome to Shostomonars. My name is Don Keonion. I'm the marketing manager for

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:07,179
 digital media and today I'm going to be covering our top 10 tips for a

3
00:00:07,179 --> 00:00:10,960
 memorable virtual event. Here at Shia we've held some of the Fortune 500 and

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,080
 Global 1000 companies host truly memorable and highly attended virtual events

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,120
 in the last few years. So we want to make sure that we can impart some of that

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,960
 experience and guidance onto you for your next virtual event. These first two

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,539
 tips are focused on how to get people to your event. Make sure that the user

8
00:00:25,539 --> 00:00:29,579
 experience for any person coming to your event page is as seamless and

9
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:33,439
 modern as possible. More and more people are browsing content on mobile devices

10
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:36,719
 or tablets. So you want to make sure the design is mobile friendly and responsive.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,880
 You also want to make sure it's inviting and engaging and that there aren't any

12
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,780
 technical barriers to entry between your viewers and the content. This means

13
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:47,740
 making sure that the site loads quickly, making sure the player is embedded in a

14
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:50,740
 way that matches the look and feel of your brand, making sure the player's

15
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:54,359
 branding reflects your brand. In a whole host of other design elements and

16
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:57,520
 technical elements you want to keep in mind when building out your event

17
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,299
 experience. Now once you've optimized your event page and really honed in on

18
00:01:01,299 --> 00:01:05,040
 that look and feel, it's important to get as many people to register for your

19
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,780
 event as possible. There will always inevitably be some drop off between the

20
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:12,060
 amount of people who register and the amount of people who actually show up. So

21
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,359
 it's important to promote your event via email, social media, paid ads, whatever

22
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:19,939
 channels you deem appropriate, to get as many people registered as possible

23
00:01:19,939 --> 00:01:23,000
 for the event. At minimum you should promote the event at least two weeks

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,739
 prior. But ideally you'd have at least four weeks of time to promote your

25
00:01:26,739 --> 00:01:30,859
 event in advance. This gives you plenty of time to follow up with people, send

26
00:01:30,859 --> 00:01:34,599
 up multiple promotions in order to get people registered before the day of the

27
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:37,400
 event. These next few tips are focused on the content itself. You want to make

28
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,239
 sure that the production quality is as high as possible given whatever resources

29
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:44,640
 you have available. Whether you have professional cameras and lighting or not.

30
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:48,719
 There's always a way that you can up the production quality and really ramp up

31
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:51,980
 the immersiveness. If you have professional cameras and lighting equipment

32
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:55,159
 that's great. A good rule of thumb to keep in mind when setting up for the show

33
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:59,700
 is to have at least one camera isolated for each speaker and then an

34
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,019
 additional camera for a wide angle or alternate angle shot. This
